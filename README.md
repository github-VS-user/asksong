# 🎶 AskSong

AskSong is a super simple web app that lets anyone suggest a song to be added to a shared playlist on Spotify. The idea is to collect good vibes, crowd-curated.

## 🚀 What It Does

- Displays a clean, modern form with two fields:
  - **Song Title + Artist**
  - **Why you recommend it**
- Submits suggestions via [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co) — no backend needed.
- Automatically redirects users to a fun **thank-you page** with animated confetti 🎉
- Fully responsive — works right in your browser.

## 🌐 Tech Used

- HTML + CSS only (no JavaScript frameworks)
- Confetti animation via pure JavaScript canvas
- Hosted via GitHub Pages
- Form powered by [FormSubmit](https://formsubmit.co) to send results to your email

## 📂 Files

- `index.html` – Main song suggestion form
- `thankyou.html` – Confirmation screen with celebration
- No external libraries. Keeping it **Simple**.
